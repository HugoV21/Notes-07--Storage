# Notes 07 Storage

### Volatile Memory 
- Volatile memory is a type of storage whose contents are erased when the system's power is turned off or interrupted. For example, RAM is volatile. 
### Non-Volatile Memory
- NV or Non-volatile memory is a term used to describe any memory or storage that is saved regardless of the power to the computer is on or off. It is also called persistent storage or permanent storage. An example of non-volatile memory and storage is a computer hard drive, flash memory, and ROM. 

- Ram : Read only memory
- Hard Drives: Two main types; HDD (hard disk drive), SSD (solid state drive)
- Optical Drive : Another common storage is optical storage, which uses lasers and lights as its method of reading and writing data. 
- Flash Drive : Alternatively referred to as a USB flash drive, data stick, pen drive, memory unit, keychain drive, and thumb drive, a jump drive is a portable storage device.

#### Disaster Recover (DR): Starts with a plan that works in conjunction with the business continuity and contingency plans.

#### Fault Tolerance: The idea that a system can continue to run properly even in the event of a failure of a component of that system.

#### Replication: In terms of data, replicated data is written to multiple hard drives possibly in multiple locations.

#### Redundancy: The idea where you have IT infrastructure in place to keep a business running, but it may be at a reduced capacity.

### Storage In the Cloud
- Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and operates data storage as a service. It’s delivered on demand with just-in-time capacity and costs, and eliminates buying and managing your own data storage infrastructure. This gives you agility, global scale and durability, with “anytime, anywhere” data access.

### Types of Cloud Storage
- Object Storage
- File Storage
- Block Storage
